# Fuzzy-Logic-based-Fire-Detection-System
The aim of this project is to develop a system for identifying fire occurrence using fuzzy logic and Arduino microcontroller. The system will utilize sensors to detect environmental parameters such as temperature, smoke, and humidity. By applying fuzzy logic algorithms to the sensor data, the system will analyze and classify the likelihood of a fire outbreak in the monitored area. The objective is to design an efficient and reliable fire detection system that can provide early warning alerts to mitigate the risk of fire-related incidents.
